# Food ordering app backend API

## Project Structure
The main module is divided into three sub-modules FoodOrderingApp-api, FoodOrderingApp-db and FoodOrderingApp-service.

In this project, we have developed from scratch REST API endpoints of various functionalities required for the web app FoodOrderingApp.  In order to observe the functionality of the endpoints, you have used the Swagger user interface and store the data in the PostgreSQL database. Also, the project is implemented using Java Persistence API (JPA).
